*Question:*
__How does the architectural design process compare to other design industries and are there any lessons that could be learnt?__

Purpose: 
1. Define the components of design
2. Understand and articulate how these interact
3. Review different architecture design processes
4. Review diffierent design processes
5. Compare design processes
6. Conclusion: Is there anything that could improve architectural process?

## components of design
Design is problem solving - there is a need for something and you need to work out what / how to solve it
The thought of how (the process) of designing is approached by different industries really interested me

## understand interactions

## review architecture design
### University

### big archi practice

### other archi practice

### different sector?

### old school 1

### old school 2

### personal experience
I guess it's because most architectural design I've seen
Is basically one concept (idea) and based off a brief, interview and a host of regulatory requirements 
Never really distinct multiple concepts with client input


## different design process
### design thinking

### UX design

### to

### other process


## compare process
### table comparison

### discussion


## conclusion
