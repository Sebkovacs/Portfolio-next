# how do other industries design?
Design is problem solving - there is a need for something and you need to work out what / how to solve it
The thought of how (the process) of designing
Is approached by different industries really interested me

Different design process
- design thinking
- UX / web design
- other
- other
- architecture


## design process 
### design thinking

### UX design


### other 1

### other 2


### architecture 
I guess it's because most architectural design I've seen
Is basically one concept (idea) and based off a brief, interview and a host of regulatory requirements 
Never really distinct multiple concepts with client input
