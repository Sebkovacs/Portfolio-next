Bishop Tyrrell Anglican College New Primary School Buildings

I was on site just after slab pours, working as a construction labourer for about ~3 months until I got a job with Paul Hickson.

This was the first commercial site I worked on and was it both eye opening and exhausting.

Being apart of construction makes you think about a lot of practical things - like: site access, staging, material storage, and efficiency of building.

I wondered how much design should consider construction and if / what are the downstream effects for the client..?
