New Primary School Buildings at Bishop Tyrrell Anglican College.
The project consisted of 2 new primary school buildings, with flexible class rooms, a new courtyard area and an upgrade to the existing basket ball courts.

I was on-site just after the initial "out of the ground" slab pour, working as a construction labourer for about ~3 months until I got a job with Paul Hickson.

We did all the core filling of the concrete block walls and a lot of other random jobs and little bits that trades weren't contracted for.

This was the first commercial site I worked on and was it both eye opening and exhausting.

Working on site revealed a few things I'd never thought about - practical things - like: site access, staging, material storage, and efficiency of building.

I wondered how much design should consider construction and if / what are the downstream effects for the client..?
