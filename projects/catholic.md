I worked on the new St Francis Xavier Catholic Church in Belmont for about 1.5 months.

My role was helping the foreman with some finishing jobs - like installing the stained glass windows.

Just before I was on site the basement slab was poured about 1 inch too high, putting it under of the legal ceiling height limit.
It had to be jack hammered down and took a couple of weeks.

If the ceiling height wasn't so tight it wouldn't have mattered. I've see a few similar incidents - expensive in both time and money.
Its always the contractor / sub-contractors at fault, but if designs weren't so tight the situations probably would have been avoided.
