I worked on the new St Francis Xavier Catholic Church in Belmont for about 1.5 months.

It was mostly helping the foreman finish off some jobs - like installing the stained glass windows.

Just before I was on site the basement slab was poured about 1 inch too high, putting it under of the legal ceiling height limit.
It had to be jack hammered down and took a couple of weeks.

On site this is a fairly common theme I saw. I though perhaps its a good lesson - that if / when possible design to give the builders a little more room to move.
