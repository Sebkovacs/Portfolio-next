This project aimed to test ideas around sustainability, affordability and public good, on urban-infill site in the heart of Newcastle.

Concept design for 10 unique apartments; mixed use development.

The goal was to hedge risk accommodating for a range of occupants and price points.

The building was designed to be constructed from CLT (per XLAM) and key priorities were achieving cross & stack (natural) ventilation and nature into the design.
