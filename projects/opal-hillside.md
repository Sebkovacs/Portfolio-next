Opal Hillside is a 4 storey, 120 suite retirement aged care facility - a big new addition to the existing facility.
It steps down the site from the main entry, off Violet Town Rd, towards the east, going from two storey to the full four storey construction at the far eastern end.

Construction is post tensioned concrete slabs and column structure with steel stud walls and exterior cladding of: Brick veneer / colorbond facade.

I worked on this project for ~2months with North, as a construction labourer. I started on-site during slab pours and went through a bit after lock up & scaffold down.

It was a very busy site and I had a good amount of exposure to the full gambit of commercial construction - the delineation of responsibilities between trades and head contractor on contract, variations and how they were handled - it got very heated on site at multiple points.

My time was about 50/50 doing odd jobs picking up from other trades and working with the North Carpenters.

Highlights were being on the other side reading plans/drawings and getting to interact with a lot of different trades / sub contractors.
