Opal Hillside is a 4 storey, 120 suite retirement aged care facility - a big new addition to the existing facility.
It steps down the site from the entry off Violet Town Rd towards the east, going from two storey to the full 4 storey construction at the far eastern end.

Construction is concrete slab and column structure with steel stud walls and exterior cladding of: Brick veneer / colorbond facade.

I worked on this project for ~2months with North, as a construction labourer - first on site during slab pours and through to finishing trades - a bit after scaffold down.

It was a very busy site and I had a good amount of exposure commercial construction - the delineation of responsibilities between trades and head contractor - and variations was good to experience - it got very heated at multiple points.

Tasks on site was a lot of odd jobs with the North Carpenters. 

Highlights were getting be part of using commerical package of plans / drawings on site and getting to interact with a lot of different trades / sub contractors. 

Interesting to see things from the other side.
