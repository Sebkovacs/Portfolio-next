Small townhouse internal renovation.

Two concepts exploring how the main living space and kitchen could be opened up. 

Concept 1 explored the idea of a larger master bedroom with ensuite.

Concept 2 explored the ideas of maximal natural light and external storage. 

Materials were tested between the two concepts.
