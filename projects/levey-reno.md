Exploring different concept ideas: feel, functon and cost.

Because of existing heigths -> flood level and existing roof
the ceiling height became the key problem.

quickly developed up a total of 5 design options with variation over 
1) roof design
2) lounge / indoor & outdoor
3) kitchen / toilet reconfiguration

the first designs : c1a & c1b
> these focused on two alternate solutions with building a box gutter and falling the new roof down towards the existing roof.
This would allow the existing roof to be kept and was thought to be the cheapest option.
the north aspect would be open. Shading requirements were basically ignored.
